# TriviaGame

### Overview
This is trivia game that was created with the intent of practicing timing using jQuery and javascript. Additionaly it uses CSS, Bootstrap and HTML. The questions are all about Kanye West. Click the start button to begin and then you have 15 seconds to select the correct answer. Wrong or Right a gif will be displayed showing whether you selection was correct or not. You must answer all the questions. 

### Purpose
This project was essential in helping me learn timing, and served as more practice with jasvscript and jQuery syntax. Combined with the formatting of bootstrap it was a very fun and challenging project to work on. I also used some google fonts in this project as well. 

### Maintenance and Contact
I maintain this project and if you have any questions, comments or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
